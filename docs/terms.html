    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p class="updated">This document was last updated on February 2025</p>

    <h2>Terms and conditions</h2>
    <p>These terms and conditions ("Agreement") set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the "Pezkuwi Wallet" mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services"). This Agreement is legally binding between you ("User", "you" or "your") and this Mobile Application developer ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our"). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such an entity to this agreement, in which case the terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Mobile Application and Services. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Mobile Application and Services.</p>

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>To ease the life of our users we decided to provide this section containing a brief summary of the highlights of this Agreement. It is important to understand that when you accept this Agreement, you are accepting full terms and conditions, not just this section. Pezkuwi Wallet provides self-hosted wallet services for managing assets in the Pezkuwi and Polkadot ecosystems. By building our application from a source code, downloading it from any application store, running it on any platform, creating or importing a wallet or visiting our website, you are agreeing to our Terms, so please read carefully. These terms outline approved uses of Pezkuwi Wallet, various licenses that we grant to you, and licenses that you grant us. If you have any questions or comments related to this Agreement, please send us a message at <a href="mailto:support@pezkuwichain.io">support@pezkuwichain.io</a> or contact us through <a href="https://t.me/pezkuwichain">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pezkuwichain">Twitter</a> or any other means of communication. If you do not agree to this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, you should stop using our Services immediately.</p>

    <h5>Accounts and membership</h5>
    <p>If you create a wallet in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur with the wallet and any other actions taken in connection with it. You should understand that we do not have access to any wallet related information on our side, nor are able to send it to any other party. All such information is stored locally on your device(s) which we don't have access to and you bear full responsibility for its(their) safety. Your wallet keys are not backed up along with other data so if you delete Mobile Application, it will be impossible to restore your keys from a backup.</p>

    <h5>Links to other resources</h5>
    <p>Although the Mobile Application and Services may link to other resources (such as websites, other mobile applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of any businesses or individuals or the content of their resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you access through a link in the Mobile Application. Your linking to any other off-site resources is at your own risk.</p>

    <h5>Push notifications</h5>
    <p>You may agree to receive push notifications from Pezkuwi Wallet in order to get updates related to your accounts balances, networks events, and Pezkuwi Wallet announcements. If you would like to receive push notifications, you must opt in to the service by accessing "Settings", then "Push notifications", and then tapping on "Enable notifications".</p>

    <h5>Dispute resolution</h5>
    <p>The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it shall be governed by the applicable laws. You hereby waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>
